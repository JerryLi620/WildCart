# WildCart

## Description

WildCart is a platform for Davidson College students to trade or purchase items from each other. Safety and security are out top priorities, and we are working on solutions to ensure trust within our community.

### Motivation

We noticed how much waste from reusable items is generated at the end of each semester during move-out. We want to provide a platform where people can exchange items they no longer want/need for items they do want/need. Second, we wanted to create a platform enabling Davidson College students to trade with each other in a safe and secure manner. As scams are seemiingly prevelant on other, more general platforms, we seek to provide a solution based on trust and community.
